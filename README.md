# term ticker
Python curses terminal application that displays your Twitter feed, RSS feeds, and monitors tickers.

Application is currently under development and it is likely that there will be breaking changes. If you clone the repo, make sure to add tools/keys.json to the untracked files (git update-index --assume-unchanged tools/keys.json), otherwise your twitter login keys will be pushed to your repo if you ever upload it.

Feel free to fork and open a pull request if you have anything you want to add. The application is working and the db/api hooks should work for anyone who clones the repo.

Please feel free to reach out. Thanks.

# Areas currently under development
The monitor window is currently not built at all, so that is currently the priority. I'm also slowly building additional commands, they will be written on an ad-hoc basis until the monitor window can display stuff.
